What is cURL?

cURL, which stands for client URL and can be written as curl (which I’ll do for the remainder of the blog because I’m lazy), is a command line tool for file transfer with a URL syntax. It supports a number of protocols including HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and many more. HTTP/HTTPS makes it a great candidate for interacting with APIs!

curl can be used on just about any platform on any hardware that exists today. This means, regardless of what you are running and where, the most basic curl commands should just work. None of the usual “it doesn’t work on my machine”.
Where do I use cURL?

You use curl in a terminal or command prompt, but you need to make sure your system already has it installed.

If you are running OS X that isn’t 10 years old, you probably have curl already installed. You can pull up the “man pages” or manual by doing curl --man in a terminal.
